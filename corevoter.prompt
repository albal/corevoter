Write a one page application using React for the frontend and python3 flask for the backend, using a postgres database and a redis cache to create solution for recording courses and allowing users to upvote courses so they are selected for development. The users should be able to anonymously login and upvote courses but not be able to upvote courses again if they come from the same ip, computer or user. The main view shows all the courses sorted by most votes. The user can select from a drop down if the courses are sorted by most votes, most trending (the system should keep a track of how popular courses are performing), newest entires and also oldest courses requests. Also the courses can be also filtered by the following state of the course, Open (The default state when a new course is created), Under Review, Planned, In Progress, Live and Closed. The user should also be given the option to see courses that they have voted for or courses that they have created. The user should be give the option to login and this then gives the option to watch courses, select which courses they want notifications on based on their previous votes. Also there should be an admin view which allows the admin to change the state on courses and also merge or delete coures. The application should suggest courses to merge based on similar course titles. The agent should create the schema for the database and ensure there are tests for the databases, backend frontend, including end to end tests to test the whole system. There should also be a text box to allow a summary of what the course should cover as well as the course title.
