The task involves developing a one-page application using React for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend. The application will use a PostgreSQL database and a Redis cache to record courses and allow users to upvote them for development. 

Here's a high-level overview of how we can approach this:

1. **Backend Development**: We'll use Flask, a lightweight web application framework for Python. It's easy to use and perfect for building a RESTful API. We'll use SQLAlchemy as the ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database. Redis will be used to store the IP addresses of users who have voted to prevent multiple votes from the same user.

2. **Frontend Development**: We'll use React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We'll use Axios for making HTTP requests to our Flask API. We'll also use React Router for routing, and Redux for state management.

3. **Database Schema**: The database will have tables for Users, Courses, and Votes. The Users table will store user information. The Courses table will store course information, including the course title, description, status, and vote count. The Votes table will store user votes, including the user ID, course ID, and timestamp of the vote.

4. **User Authentication**: We'll implement anonymous user authentication by generating a unique ID for each user and storing it in a cookie. This ID will be used to identify the user in subsequent requests.

5. **Course Voting and Sorting**: Users will be able to upvote courses. The main view will show all courses sorted by the number of votes. Users will also be able to sort courses by trending, newest, and oldest. We'll implement this functionality on the backend and provide endpoints for the frontend to fetch the sorted data.

6. **Course Status Filtering**: Users will be able to filter courses by their status (Open, Under Review, Planned, In Progress, Live, Closed). We'll implement this functionality on the backend and provide an endpoint for the frontend to fetch the filtered data.

7. **Admin View**: Admins will be able to change the status of courses and merge or delete courses. We'll implement this functionality on the backend and provide endpoints for the frontend to fetch and update the data.

8. **Testing**: We'll write unit tests for the backend using a framework like pytest. For the frontend, we'll use Jest and React Testing Library. We'll also write end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress.

9. **Course Suggestions**: We'll implement a course suggestion feature that suggests courses to merge based on similar titles. We'll use a library like fuzzywuzzy for fuzzy string matching to find similar titles.

10. **Notifications**: Users will be able to select which courses they want notifications on based on their previous votes. We'll implement this functionality on the backend and provide an endpoint for the frontend to fetch and update the data.

This is a complex task that involves many different aspects of web development, including backend and frontend development, database design, user authentication, data sorting and filtering, admin functionality, testing, and more. We'll need to carefully plan and coordinate our efforts to successfully complete this task.
